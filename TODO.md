# plans
the plans for this are: (todo: fill this out)

## Multiversal (Layer 5)
this layer is reached by trying to "save" the game during the END sequence, a popup will occur telling the player they can't save this reality, and here a different progression starts

## Atomics (Layer 6)
at the end of the multiversal section of spatial studies, you will be able to unlock the atomic layer by (tbd)

## Quantum (Layer 7)
quantum physics stuff can be unlocked here by some other spatial study

## Meta (Layer 8)
you reach this by reaching e9e15 antimatter in a big rip

## Ascension (Layer 9)
you reach this by, idk

## Omnisity (Layer 10)
